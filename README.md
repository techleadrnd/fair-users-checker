# 🔍 Fair Users Checker

A data analysis tool built with Python and `pandas` to compare behavioral patterns between fair users and fraudsters based on user profiles and transaction data.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on four datasets:

- 👤 `fair_users.csv`
- 🕵️ `fraud_users.csv`
- 💳 `transactions_by_fair_users.csv`
- 🧨 `transactions_by_fraudsters.csv`

It visualizes key differences in demographics, KYC status, transaction behavior, and merchant interactions — helping you spot anomalies and patterns that may indicate fraud.
